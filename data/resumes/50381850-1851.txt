PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

1965-68. Graduate research (Master's) at the University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan.
‘Advisor: Dr. A. Tsugita. Elucidation of the amino acid sequence of wild type and double-frameshift
mutant lysozyme from T4 phage. This work confirmed forthe first time the genetic code via in vivo
experiments.

‘Advisor: Dr. C. Baglioni, Majors areas of research: a) Mechanisms of protein synthesis using cell-
free systems; b) Characterization of globin and histone mRNAs; c) Demonstration and
characterization of matemal messenger RNAs in unfertilized sea urchin eggs.

1972-77, Postdoctoral research at the University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.
‘Advisor: Dr. M. Crippa. Initiated experiments on gene expression during Drosophila oogenesis.

1977-83. Assistant Professor, Department of Developmental Genetics & Anatomy, Case Western
Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio,

1983-93, Associate Professor, Dept. of Genetics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.

11993-present. Professor, Dept. of Genetics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.
