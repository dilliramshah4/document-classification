DISCOVERIES (chronological):

1) Two novel human blood-group active sugars in higher plants. 2) Proof that anti-blood
group 1-Fris ich (T) & Tn antibodies in man are predominantly elicited by
intestinal flora, and, in addition, by antigen (Ag) inhalation & ingestion. 3) Biological, physical
‘and full chemical characterization of a vertebrate lectin. 4) Isolation & characterization of septic
(toxic) shock receptors to which microbial toxins attach before eliciting lethal shock. 5)
Demonstration of the importance of hydrophobic monosaccharides as specific precipit
anti-H(O) lectin. This contrasts with general belief that, "latice formation” is a
immunological-serological specific precipitin reactions. 6) 2 patents with CIBA-GEIGY. 7)
Demonstration of heavy contamination of all commercial influenza virus vaccine with blood
‘Aclike and Forssman Ags (danger in pregnancy). 8) Discovery that one gene can control both
blood group Ag- and virus receptor-specificity (including tumor causing viruses) e.g.: (i) human
MN epitopes (Eps) & specific myxovirus receptors (Rpt); (ii) infectious mononucleosis Paul-
Bunnell Ag specific receptor and putative Rpt for the Epstein-Barr tumor virus; (ii) chicken blood
‘group R1-isoAg Rpt for Rous Sarcoma and myxoviruses. 9) Characterization of human blood.
‘group MN-specific Ags & Eps by mild stepwise degradation and biosynthesis. 10) Discovery of
human T & Tn Ags as: (i) specific pancarcinoma (CA)-markers, (ii) -auto-Ags, (iii) -adhesion,
iv) -motility molecules. T & Tn are not immunoaccessible in diseased and healthy tissues, except
some leukemias. 11) Relative and absolute densities of T & Tn on CA cells, permit stratification of
patients for adjuvant therapy, post primary surgery. 12) Over 85% of all human CAs elicit very
sarly, and throughout strong, readily detectable cellular and humoral anti-CA-T & -Tn immune
Tesponses of high diagnostic (even yrs prior to positive biopsy) and prognostic value, 13)
Discovery that may cary Tn, T.N & MEps. 14) Successful active, specific
vaccination wit T Ag (ASTI) of breast CA patients Stages III & IV up to >15 yrs.
Probability that our combined ASTI results (survival rate) are due to chance: 5 yrs, p< 107; 10
yt, p< 10 that the survival rates, obtained by use, are due to chance, (p less than 1 in 10
imillion in 5 yrs and less than 1 in 100 million persons after 10 yrs). (5 or less in 100 is statistically
significant) (statistically significant is probability p $ 0.05 x 10).
