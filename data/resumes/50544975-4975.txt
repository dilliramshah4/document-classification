ACADEMIC DEGREES

1985: Degree in Chemistry from the University of Barcelona.
1992: Ph. D. Degree in Chemistry from the University of Barcelona.

2. JOB AT THE UNIVERSITY

From 1985 | have been working in the Department of Chemical Engineering of the Universitat
Politgcnica de Catalunya as:

1986 - 1991: assistant professor,

1991 - 1996: associate professor.

3.- RESEARCH

| am working in the structure determination by crystallography of single crystals. The
molecules | have been studied are:

a) Small basic peptides.

b) One nucleoside.

¢) Some oligodesoxinucleotides.

Steps of the structure determination:

1 Crystallization of the molecule (single crystal), usually by vapour diffusion technique in
sitting or hanging drops.

2.- Mounting the crystal in a capilary.

3. Data collection by X-ray diffraction, usually using Cu Ka as radiation.

4.- Data processing, correction and reduction,

5.- Resolution of the structure.

6.- Refinement of the structure.

7. Analysis of the structure and possible relation with function.

The two first cases (a and b) are small molecules, but the third one {c) are macromolecules, so
the methods applied in solving structures are differant. In cases a and b the structures are
‘solved by direct methods, but in case c, the structures are solved by molecular replacement. The
refinement procedure is also different according to the size of the molecule. With this knowledge
| am now interested in getting broader experience and enter the field of protein structure.

Because of the difficulty in getting good crystals for X-ray diffraction, some
oligodesoxinucleotides have been preliminary studied by Raman and FTIR.
