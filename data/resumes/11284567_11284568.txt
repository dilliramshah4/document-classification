Mainly involved in the synthesis, analysis and isolation of
certain carcinogens from marijuana cigarette smoke condensates
with extensive employment of modern techniques i.e. IR, UV,
column, paper, thin layer and gas chromatography and liquid
scintillation spectrometry. Recently developed methods for
quantitative determination of some carcinogens. Duties include
supervision of a group of assistants. Also involved in several
contract proposals.

1968 to 1970

Postdectoral Fellow, Howard University, Washington, D. Cc.
Participated in the synthesis of azepines and established
their configurations innovating experiments to resolve
Previous contraversies.

Postdoctoral Fellow, Baylor University, Waco, Texas

Synthesized a hydroperoxide and investigated its
decomposition pathways contributing many original ideas.
