FW: Comments on WRA / JT agenda

 

Mark has aptly characterized those comments of mine that belong in an “outside the department communication” from
those internal to the department. The latter could go into your cover to Denise and/or remain as issues to be cognizant of
for the actual meeting. Indeed, my parenthetical observations were just that and were offered more as points of concern
than for further dissemination.
