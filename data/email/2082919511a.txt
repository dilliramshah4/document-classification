RE! Spee Consolation
I'm scheduled for the OBT presentation on 6/16th.
Please help me by doing the following:

 

+ Is the RFP still in the picture? If the answer is yes, then | need to know that, if the answer is
partial RFP then | need to know that too. - in this breadth, how do you propose for us to split
our numbers with or without RFP?

* Please take my original numbers and do the ROI! analysis with and without RFP, i.e., please
take the expense portion out, but still reflect expense portion as a separate line item.

! appreciate your help.
