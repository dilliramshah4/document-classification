RE: TES- Informed Gonsent

 

 

1 saw the IC and assumed it was made from the last Covance IC for the pilot study. We may have to expect that all sites
having their own IRB may come up with slightly different ICs.

Subject: _TES- Informed Consent

Hans:

Chris Nelson calied me this morning with a question about the draft Informed Gonsent for the TES Multi-Genter study
from Covance. Essentially, he is questioning why we are considering to use a new (Covance's) format for the
Informed Consent. Given the time and input already put into the IC format used with the MDS studies, he is trying to
understand our rationale for introducing another IC format.

| wasn’t sure whether this was based on the IC used in the TES pilot study, nor was | entirely clear on the rationale
{does each CRO have their own IC format?), So | told him } would talk to you and get back with him as soon as
Possible.

He will review the Covance IC as is, if that is what we want, but | think he ultimately raises the question from the
standpoint of consistency. Please let me know your thoughts/rationale so that I can get back to him.

‘Thanks,
Valerie
