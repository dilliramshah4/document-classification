Dear Legislator:

 

  

If you are thinking about raising your
what has happened in New York State
. contra

igarettc tax, 1 ask you stop and seriously examine
where the state has n trying to deal with ive
ming rate.

   

Statistics provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and our state's revenue department
illustratc the magnitude of this contraband problem:

 

Analysis of Official Data
Reveals Level of Illegal Sales

New York Revenue Department data show that the per capita legal, 1ax-paid
sales of cigarettes in New York is 70.5 packs a year. But studies by the U.S.
‘Centers’ for Discase Control indicate that per capita consumption in New
York is 97.4 packs, which is just slightly above the national average.

 

 

70 packs per person “sold” in N.Y.

97 packs actually consumed in N.Y.

Where are the missing packs coming from? Answer: New Yorkers
purchase them illegally. The numbers indicate that today, nearly 27 percent
lof New York's entire cigarette market is contraband -- sales that have
avoided New York State’s high cigarette tax.

 

 

‘A major source for this illegal, tax-free market in our state is the Indian Reservations. At 56 cents
per pack, New York's cigarette tax encourages consumers to buy at Indian smoke shops -- where
no cigarette tax is collected and no sales tax is charged. The “savings” to consumers is $6.42 a
carton (state cigarette tax, plus sales tax). “Joss” slate i F us
estimated to be up to $233 million a year -- coupled with a huge loss to the state's Iegal retail
industry.

 

Bylaw, this shouldn’t have happened. The Supreme Court ruled several years ago that New
York State had the authority to regulate Indian sales of cigarettes to non-tribal members. But the.
regulations have not been enforced. Just today, however, the Governor's office announced that it
would try to reach an agreement with “traditional” state tribes and begin enforcement by April 1.
