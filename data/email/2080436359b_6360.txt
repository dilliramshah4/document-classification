- ! received further information on the glow in the dark band. There are 3 separate patents we will need to
‘obtain from the vendor for legal approval. As this will take additional time we may have to go with the original band in

The new price is $.195/ea. (set ups included).
‘Sequential numbering may not be available on this band. | have a call into the vendor on this and will let you know as
