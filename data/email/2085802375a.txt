Subject: Communispond Contrect - Presentation SMS

Ellen - 1 wanted to get back to you on behalf of the Professional Development Council to address your questions
about the Communispond contract, the vender thal the Professional Development Council selected to conduct the
two-day Executive Presentation Skills Semingr in Richmond, Nov. 12" and 13.

You asked:
1. Who will be attonding?; and
2. How did wa choose this vendor?

First, below is the most recent list of attendees .. We still have space for 4 additional attendees due to some
recent schedule conflicts/travel concems . Attendees were selected by their managers after Chery! sent an e-mail
to Terry, Mike and Liz asking for nominations based on individual developments! needs and interests.

Second. we first heard of Communispond through Denise McQueen who was able to take the same course
offered ihrough Corporate, Corporate Affairs. We then spoke to Tara Staniey in that department to get more
Information and, It turns out, Communispong Is the vender they've used for a few years to de presentation skills
training. Based on positive ‘recommendations about the course, we then met with Communispond to make sure
their program fit with our needs. We were all in agreement with this vendor end were especially receptive to thelr
apparent ability to individualize the treining for everyone in the group despite level of experience.
