Jamie - when Y&R bills us for the lasering project, do you know if that will need to be billed under a
separate estimate to the rest of the project? Right now, it's under one estimate that does not
differentiate between the printing of the letterhead and envelopes, the lasering and stuffing, and
the mailing costs. Please let me know. I'll be ina meeting from 2-3 in 120/15C if you need to reach
me. Thanks.
