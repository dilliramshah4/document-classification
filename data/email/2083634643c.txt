Subject: ‘Meeting with Research Intemational
Hi Denise-

' hope you had a great weekend.

Would you be able to check Carolyn's calendar for some time (an hour) on March 16th, preferably on the
earlier side... maybe 11am. Research International will be here and we would like to meet on the weighting
for TABS.

Thanks!
