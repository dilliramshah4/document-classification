Subject: | enjoyed your talk at Philip Morris

lonjoyed the talk you gave recently at Philip Morris. My background is
chemical engineering. | have read articles on genomics and seen
presentations. For me, they are typically either too geared for

specialists, or simple, but with lots of hype. Iam often left with either

the impression that genomics is much too complex, or that everything is in
order and if | sit back, great things will happen.

 

Your talk, by contrast, led me to think, and to want to know more about
human genomics. Thank you for cutting through the hype and presented a
fascinating tale of scientific discovery.

If you could suggest a primer on the subject of human genomics, I would
appreciate it.

Thanks,
Pete
