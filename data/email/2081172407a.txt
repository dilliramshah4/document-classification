I had a long conversation with Mary JO. I'm fine with thé followup to the
specific incident & the handling of the corporate affairs contribution.

However -- I'm really concerned (&very cynical) about what might be
happening. I suspect this was not by coincidence. I'm not sure how much it
was preplanned -- but Mary Jo can share with several different scenarios that we
brainstormed.

Mary Jo promised to keep on alert for any unusual activity in the current 3
markets -~ and is going to think about whether there are any preventative steps
we can/should ta

If it happens again in another market ~~ 'm not sure what we are going to need
fo do. But I don’t think we can continue to push ahead and be a target.

Lets plan to talk again affer we see what goes on in the current markets.
