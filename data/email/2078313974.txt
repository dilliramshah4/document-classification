Seda,

Both NBC and The Washington Post are covering the BAT document, tonight for the
former and tomorrow morning for the latter.

David Reemes commented on the record with the following:

Because of attorney client privilege, T can't comment on document purporting to
deseribe meeting with client. However, it is not unusual or improper for
lawyers to help clients identify experts, including scientific experts, on
matters of potential regulatory, legislative or litigation significants or to
work with experts.

Kur is Socusing on the "controversy" phrase and David thinks he will say this
doc was in response to industry on the ropes, a desperate move. Bob told David
that he would like to get his hands on CRS report which I am trying to do.

David believes Washington Post is trying to be balanced. Reporter read back to
him comment from "industry lawyer" re: EYS IS controversial and reporter
apparently is including a box that goes into CRS report.
