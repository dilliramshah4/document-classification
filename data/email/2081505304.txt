Enza,

Four consultants that will be involved in the 3/24 Sr Team presentation will
arrive at the NY office first thing Monday morning. We plan to begin going
cover some revisions of our presentation at Sam in the 26th floor conf. room.

â€˜They wil? need to get in the building and I instructed them to say they were
visiting Jack. Since they are contracted exployees, I assume the desk will

call up to you/Jack before letting them come up. Would it be possible for you
to help facilitate their entry and direct them to the conference room on 26?

 

Their names are: Martin Browning fron EduQuest company, Art Levine from
Arnold & Porter (he may arrive with me) and Bd McDonnell & Tom Meyers fron
Quintiles BRI Company.

 

Z imagine they will arrive around 8:45am.

Thanks, Bnzat guay
