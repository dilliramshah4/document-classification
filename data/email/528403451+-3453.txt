IMPORTANT REQUEST--

As previously communicated, changes have been made in the Merchandising Tables to capture the Pack
and Carton account conditions important to measuring the success of our 1996 Retail Partners Marketing
Plan implementation.

‘Your immediate assistance is requested to accurately update these indicators by February 16, 1996.

In order to simplify, insure consistency, and request only the most critical information the following
measures have been taken:

‘+ Reduction of Indicators
Effective January 29, 1996 the Merchandising Tables will be modified and the process will be started
to clean out all old Table entries. The previous set of indicators will be removed as you receive a full
ownload on your laptop, Poget or Norand as appropriate.

The current merchandising entries are listed below. These ‘9" entries will reside under the sub-
heading ‘RJR Pack’ for ease of entering.

The indicators are to be used to capture conditions in both Pack and Carton Outlets. Please note
some indicators are directed toward Pack Outlets while others apply to both Carton and Pack

accounts.
