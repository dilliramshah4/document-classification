Nurea,
â€˜Thanks, as always, for your thorough response.
Here's what I would like you to do:
- Please process the last diskette from FLR to see if we get enough cases of free product to:
do the analysis that you recommended.
~ At the same time, please make another set of comparison charts of test vs control using the
most recent STARS data (12/6).
As always, please let me know when I can expect each of these pieces.
Thanks.
