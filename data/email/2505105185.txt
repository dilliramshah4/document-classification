itis interesting to see PAREXELS suggestions on biomarkers for the TES.

   

 

Could our 4 biomarker specialists (and their support - Rustemeier etc.) have a look at these suggestions and give me their
opinion as to whether we should consider some of ihe suggestions for the Total Exposure Study some time early Next Week?

Have a nice weekend,
Roger
