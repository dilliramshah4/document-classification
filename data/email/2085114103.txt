Hi Jamie-

As you can see there are 4 versions of the MES Mailing outlined as follows:

4) The Intranet deskdrop to all PM USA Employees who have access to computers.

2) The Intranet deskdrop to the Fied Sales Force—-we specifically call attention to the fact that they will be getting the

brochure in the mail as they don't have an office to pickup brochures.

3) FSF Mailing: This is the same letter as in point #2 above, however, we need to mail them the brochure to FSF

employees who get the electronic deskdrop and so we have altered the feng. to say, “Enciosed Is @ copy of the new YSP
let..."

4) The intranet deskdrop which must be posted on the bulletin boards in the plant communities for employees w/o

computers.

As we moved forward w/ the deskdrop details, we realized that a single letter (what you originally approved) would have
alienated a large number of employees and as such, the minor modifications have been made w/o impacting content.

Let me know if you have any questions.
