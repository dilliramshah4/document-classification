Subject: ‘Grde K "We Card” payment

 

venny,
After speaking with Elisa about Circle K, she asked me to follow up with you a few things.

7. We need to see a copy of the permission letter from the "we card” coalition to Circle K allowing
them to create their own “we card” signage.

2. Are we currently supplying any "we card” signage to Circle K?

3. We would like to take a 100k at these newly created we card graphics.

4. We need to determine the average per store cost of our "we card” signage vs. the $4 Circle Kis
proposing.

Let me know if you need my help with any of this. Talk to you soon.
