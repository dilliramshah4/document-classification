IGOM Conference Call Recap

 

Hi Everyone,

Following is a re-cap of today's conference call:

ICOM will conduct the microfilm/tape preparation process by survey database, and will
provide batches of names at the end of October, November & December. The minimum
batch size is to be 250,000. All names will hopefully be delivered by the end of
December (ICOM to confirm).

 

ICOM will provide estimated quantities/delivery dates for microfilm and tapes for each of
the three months, and will forward to me asap.

Once we receive the October microfilm & tapes, conduct MSCI Q/C, and determine

New/Update quantities, we will decide if there are enough names for a December "New
Name" recertification mailing - to include the first of 3 batches of ICOM Names only.

Program Set-Up Instructions
7. ICOM will revise the estimated quantity of names for program #99128 and #99129
and I will forward to Mary.

2. The data tape test dump will consist of 50 randomly selected names from each of
ICOM's surveys (Spring 98, Fall 98, Spring 99).

Contract

1 will follow-up with the 2nd draft of the contract and forward to ICOM for review.
Please let me know if you have any questions/changes and have a great weekend!
Thanks,

Vicki
