Your Ref. 00-09-29754
Dear Mr. Poser:

Lam writing in response to the matter of A.V. Del Prete raised in your October 30, 2000 letter to
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. R. J. Reynolds does not fix the retail price of its products, Retailers,
not the manufacturer, set the retail price of DORAL and other RJ. Reynolds brands. Therefore, it would

appear that if Mr. Del Prete has an issue with regard to the retail price of DORAL it would be with the
individual retailer.

 

T trust that this clarifies the matter. Do not hesitate to call me should you have uny questions,

Sincerely.
