+ Atanews conference on 11/16, Attorneys General for several states including Washington,
Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, North Dakota, New York, and Colorado announced and released a proposed
settlement agreement with tobacco companies, stating the settlement “moves the fight out of the
courtroom and onto the streets so we can begin protecting kids now.” Under the $206 billion
settlement proposal, tobacco companies would agree to “curbs on their advertising and marketing
campaigns, fund a $1.5 billion anti-smoking campaign, open previously secret industry documents, and
disband industry trade groups,” including The Tobacco Institute, Council for Tobacco Research, and
Council for Indoor Air Research. Attorneys General for the remaining states have until Friday to sign
on to the agreement.

 

 

 

   

+ The full U.S Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied on 11/11 FDA’s request to re-hear the August 14
decision of a three-judge panel of the Court which ruled that FDA does not have the authority to
regulate cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. The Clinton Administration plans to appeal the decision to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

   

+ Rob Reiner, chair of the Prop. 10 campaign announced on 11/11 that the California Children and
Families Initiative had been approved by voters, stating, “California voters saw through Big Tobacco’s
smokescreen and voted to improve the future of California’s children rather than protecting tobacco
company’s profits.” The Committee Against Unfair Taxes acknowledged “that they do not have
enough absentee votes to overcome the current deficit.” Prop. 10 increases the tobacco tax by 50 cents
per pack to fund children’s health care and early childhood development programs, effective 1/1/99.
