Keane, Denise; Murphy, Virginia

David Curle from Richmond called asking about the note below and similarly whether or not
‘we can send replacement cigarettes to consumers in NY who have a product complaint. I
vaguely remember that we didn’t have a problem sending replacement product into

Minnesota and I thought we were leaning towards resuming sending replacement product in
NY but I wanted to check with you before responding.
