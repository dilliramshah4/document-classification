Subject: OUT oF’stock

Jim and Jim - We were informed today when our order was called In that Salem
FF slide box would be back ordered until 5/29 - this is an item on our non-
compliance list - please tell me how this will be handled if a store is found non-
compliant for not having this as one of the two items. You must remember that
failure to not have this item in the warehouse until next Wednesday means that a
store could be out of stock for two weeks before them can reorder.
