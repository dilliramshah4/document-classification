‘Subject: RE: Model Plant Cmbes Highlight Report

 

(We forgot to include B&GC of NC under strategic partnerships (that’s 2 biggie), and | would add Right Choices
conference in VA under community action. TH: anything else? KC, pls add and Il forward to CJL and EM.)

Truly excellent job everybody! Hard to believe it has only been one year since we've had this focus and had our
first couple of meetings about RIC and CAB. As a team we have done tremendous work.

 

   

And, thank you KC for keeping the ball rolling on coor:

  

ation, reporting and follow-up!

CR: You should know that we will be selecting new and different model communities (non plant communities) in
the next couple of weeks where will be doing these things and more in 2000.

 

As we move into these other markets with our strategic focus areas and grass roots work, the model plant
community project will enter a new phase that will focus on PM-specific resources. As KC mentions below: t
includes a) working with FSF on yap, b) promoting employee volunteerism with youth, mentor and parent

programs, c) more internal communications on ysp and ¢) begin supplier/business pariner involvement in ysp.

 

We can talk more about these four items on next call or meeting. But, before we start on the new, take some time
to reflect on ail the accomplishments last year. It's quite impressive.

Once again, great work by alll You guys make tough work a whole lot easier and a whole [ot of fun.

Happy New Year and Happy New Millenium!
