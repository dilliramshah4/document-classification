Subject: RE: 3rd Party POS

 

Given everyone's schedule, we're going to do this in 2 parts. On Thursday, July 13 from 1:30 - 2:30

Y&R will show creative to Carolyn, KD and me.

1 will then take Jeanne, Christina and Marti through it either on Friday when they return, or early next
week.

AB/CW - if you're around on Thurs, please join us.
Kim: please book a room for Thursday and advise.
Thanks.
