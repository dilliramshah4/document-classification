Hi Carolyn-

Just wanted to share the revised, laid-out employee suggestion form w/ you, along w/ the promotional flyer that will
be distributed at the plant communities (for those who don't have access to ihe intranet) encouraging employees
to submit their ideas. You have seen the language as part of the review process so the content is not new, just
the design (which we placed on approved YSP letterhead).

Pleasâ€™

 

me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
Thanks-

Eric Ostern,
Manager, Youth Smoking Prevention Programs.
