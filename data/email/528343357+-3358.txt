Dear Ray:

This is the Winston's 21st year of NHRA Drag Racing sponsorship. And with our
Winston Select 10 driver's points bonus program debut, we're all expecting an exciting
race season. This program adds momentum to the company's overall objective of
increasing trial and awareness of Winston Select by supporting our smoker conversion
program and increasing Select signage. It also helps to strengthen the commitment of
drivers and teams as they help us remind smokers that Winston brings the sport of drag
racing to them.

This year's Sports Marketing team consists of the following personnel:

Rick Hauser, Senior Manager (910) 741-6486
Bryan Pierce, Assistant Manager (910) 741-4834
Sara Ayers, Assistant Manager (910) 741-2842

Deb Brittsan, Miss Winston

We all will be staying at the Hilton in East Brunswick if you need to contact us during
race week (908) 828-2000.

On behalf of the Winston Drag Racing Team, | am providing the following information to
assist you with your event planning for the upcoming Mopar Parts Nationals at Old
Bridge Township Raceway Park, May 19-21.

The Mobile Activity Unit (MAU) will again be in Englishtown. This exhibit is designed
to interact with consumers much the same way as the Winston Pavilion did in the
past. Components of the MAU include a Winston Motorsports simulator, large
message board, competitive pack exchange booths, and interactive race games.
The MAU will not include a premium store this year. if you have any questions
regarding the MAU, please call Michae! Wright (910) 741-2895 or Steve Tucker

(910) 741-6673.

In addition to the MAU, a hospitality area exclusively for fans who are RIRT
smokers, will be featured adjacent to the MAU area. This area shows our support to
our franchise and newly converted smokers. SME provides refreshments to them
and also opportunities to receive driver's autographs
