‘Subject: Marlboro Menthol Beier

Attached is a draft of the Marlboro Menthol brief. Please note that Brand has not officially approved the brief, but it
includes the information that we received from Brand based on our last conference call.

Please review and include any items that you believe have been omitted. | have also included a bullet on a ROB
gatefold. During Mack 6's first brainstorming session, this magazine unit was discussed to showcase continuity items. It

will also assist with the team’s name generation objective. We can discuss this in more detail after our Thursday meeting.

‘Since budget and timing is still TBD, it is important for us to provide costs in a building block format. This will enable
Brand to “cherry pick” different options. A full preliminary pian document is not necessary (and not feasible) at this point.

Piease call with any questions.
Thanks.
