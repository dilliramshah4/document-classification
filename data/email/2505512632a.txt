SAAC funding for 2000

   

According to my records, the studies which are bolded on the enclosed
spreadsheet should have been completed this year. I am organizing the SRRC
meeting for November 16 and would like to make sure that these studies do not
require any additional funding for 2000. Please check this spreadsheet and make
sure my records are accurate.

I would appreciate your response by Monday, November 8th.
Thank you.
