RE: Alternate putt profiles

 

Mike - Your group is certainly in the loop. We need to discuss having your folks run the metals analysis of the JLI under
the exaggerated conditions as well as the GC/MS Fingerprinting of particulate and GVP from JLI. As a altemate, we
could use the whole smoke, puff by puff analysis. I'm not familiar with the puff to puff work, but if you think it will provide
more information, we are interested. Bill Gardner did the previous GC/MS Fingerprinting work to determine the semi-
quantitative differences between the CaCO3 and AMP smokes in the EHCSS. Possibly Bill could compare the
differences in the two phases with puffing conditions. Give me a call

Gest regards,
Robbie Elves

Everyone - Bill Rickert at Labstat sent this to me with regard to their experience and ability to perform alt puff
profiles on their machines, FYI with regard to our efforts on the "JLI-TOPOGRAPHY™ Study.

Best regards,

Robbie Elves

Robbie - based on the reponse from Pete (see attached) we should be able to work within the range of
parameters of interest.
