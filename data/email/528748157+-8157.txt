Statement by RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Regarding FTC’s Joe Camel Case

November 23, 1998

The following statement was issued by Guy Blynn, deputy general counsel and vice
president of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. following a motion by the staff of the Federal
Trade Commission to dismiss the agency’s case against Joe Camel advertising:

“Obviously, we are delighted that the FTC’s case against our company apparently has
been brought to an end by the staff's motion to dismiss.

“Based on what was presented at trial, the FTC’s motion to dismiss is consistent with the
Federal Trade Commission's decision in 1994 that concluded: ‘Although it may seem
intuitive to some that the Joe Camel advertising campaign would lead more children to
smoke or lead children to smoke more, the evidence to support that intuition is not there.’

“We are pleased that the 10-year investigation of the Joe Camel advertising campaign
appears to be at an end.”
