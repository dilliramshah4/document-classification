Gina,

It was so nice to see you in Puerto Rico and to have sometime to catch up. Thanks again
for letting us know about the B&GC programs which hopefully I've done a fairly decent job
of describing below.

is there anything you can send us about them? In advance, thanks! And hope your holiday
was great.
