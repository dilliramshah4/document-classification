RE: Diréct Mail Piece

   

‘Sorry for the confusion. Just tried to reach you and you are net in. Can you meet Friday @ 11:30 to discuss/finalize plan?

In the meantime, don’t worry, | will pay for the production of the 1,000,000 booklets. I might even be able to afford part of
the postage. depending on the costs. FYI—Karen Chaikin sent the brochure weight to you as well as Jen Roberti last week

to help you determine costs. Hope this helps.
Looking forward to our meeting to get everything finalized. This is a great opportunity for us to integrate our efforts.
