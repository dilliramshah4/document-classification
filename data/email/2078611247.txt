Subject: LAM Comparisons:

Norma,

As I told you this AM, the current L&M delivery comparisons are as follows:

* US Sourced Puerto Rico L&M KS - 13 mg Tar (Current Design,
Production date TBD)

* US Produced USA Domestic L&M KS - 15 mg (Current Design ,
Production scheduled for 5/12)

+ Both use same materials of construction and blend/flavor systems.

| have reviewed this comparison with Marc Chemla (Director, inti Design
Function) and Urs Nyffeler.

With the Puerto Rico design, we are matching a current Guatemala design @
13 mg amd want the newly sourced product to be sensorially transparent.

For the USA Domestic desian, we are flexible and can use a 13 mg KS
design, since:

© from the NPC our only marching order was “Keep it Simple”
* Liggett KS product measures about 12.5-13.5mg Tar
* we could consolidate the two designs to one - Operations efficiencies

Our Design Team is assessing the logistics of putting the new Domestic
design change into play.

if all OK, should we proceed with the 13 mg design - or do you still want the
spreadsheet of current designs (for Legal Review) as we discussed?

Thanks,

Ken Newman
