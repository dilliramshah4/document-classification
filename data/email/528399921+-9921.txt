Maura --

Here's a short section | put together from two documents: a consumer letter that
lauco was going to pass by Andy last week; and a risk-reduction document that
was approved six months ago by R&D management and by Andy, Chuck and
Mike Johnson, but has not received final blessing for distribution from Chuck or
Mike.

If you think this works, I think that Tommy and Chuck and Rucker need to
approve and that Tommy and/or Chuck needs to determine if Andy needs to
approve.

If Andy needs to approve, that needs to happen today.
