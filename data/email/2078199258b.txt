Subject: RE: NH Smoking Ban Bill Proposed Testimony .
We haven't set up a conference call for this, however we can. Several schedules have
changed around here, including Matt's. I'm waiting for him to get back to me on a fime for this
aftemoon. Once we have this locked, we can set up a dial-in number. In the mean time. the
extra time that we have will hopefully provide you and Paula with the ability to review the draft
testimony sent earlier that was reviewed/approved by Ellen and Mark pending your input.
