Here is the letter to be sent to ANVS, marked to show Clodoaldo's comments. Could you please make sure to insert the

proper accents since | donâ€™t have Portuguese accents in my computer. | deleted the last phrase of item 4 because you

Biready have the portuguese translation of the studies. Thank you all very much and please call us if you have questions.
egards,
