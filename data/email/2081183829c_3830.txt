Jack/Joe,

The Virginia Slims brand group would like to hold an employee sale in mid-July
offering items from the last VS Catalog which expired in May. All items are non-
branded and have no logo or indicia. The items that would be offered are listed

all employees/temps at 120/100 Park, Ryebrook and Tarrytown. We also would
like to have no limits on quantity -- first come first serve. The sale would be run
by Margo Cochran and the profits from the sale would be split between VS brand
and PMEF.
