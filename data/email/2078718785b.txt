Subject: __ Cambricige Repositioning - Core Team

ASSL8IL8L07

I'd like to Invite each of you - or one of your representatives - to join me in a series of meetings to revitalize the Cambridge
rand and effectively reposition it. | have already been working with many of you towards this goal, but itis now time to
formalize these efforts.

 

To that end, I'd like to start bi-weekly meetings for Tuesdays, from 11-12 in 8at/a2, to create, develop and imptement all the
elements to successfully relaunch Cambridge. | chose this time because It comes right after the Discount promotion weekly
meeting which many of you already attend. Please let me know if this time will not work for you. For those of you in
Richmond, we can conference call you in, So please let me know if the time works for you as well.

During this first meeting, I'll explain the purpose of this repositioning and bring you up to speed on some of the wonderful
work that has already been done. Together, we will create a plan to pull this off and create some excitement about
Cambridge.

Hook forward to seeing you all on Tuesday.

Thanks, Denise @ 3-3415
