Lagree with both of Ted's re ses (the two paragraphs Dolow) rogarding this ETS panor. | havo to comment that its
important to me that the maintenance of the web site re. scientific issues needs fo have scientific control at a broad level,
ot just article by article. Without that, the balance of articles could easily be imbalanced, eg, the artic’es that make it aré
‘ones which recieve media attention.

 

Here were Ted's comments:
I spoke to Tony. He feels that the issue is quite important. He also feels that simply reviewing this erticie will not
necessaniy get us (WSA) to the point that we need to be, but that we rather need to review the entire literature on this
subject. He will prepare a short review, that will undoubledly conclude with the viewpoint that these findings are
interesting, but that much more work néeds to be done to put them into perspective. As already indicated, he feels that the
requisite effort is important to us and will do it. However, that you won't get quickly.

 

 

Lassume that you ere referring to the articie by William P. Bennett, et al.. entitled "Environmental Tobacco Smoke, Genotic
‘Susceptibility, and Risk of Lung Cancer in Never-Smoking Women.” published in Journal of the National Cancer Institute
(91: 2009-2014, 1999). Ihave not yet read this article: however, Tony Tricker has. Tony's opinion is that it is an extremely
poor article that, in particular, fails to cite a great deal of relevani literature that is not in agreement with ihe sulhor’s
conclusions. Tony is sufficiently concerned with the quality of the erticle that he is drafting a potential letter to the editor
night this minute. Fe will Be finished it today. and | will discuss itwith Rick next week. We will be more than happy to Keep
you in the loop.
