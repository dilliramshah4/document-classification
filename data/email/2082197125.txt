RE: Copy of CA home site updates and doc.

 

While reviewing the attached documents, | received a phone call from Tiffany Wallace who is in the Ohio State
Government Affairs office. Both she and her management felt the need for a website identifying who they are, the regions
they are responsible for, etc... She was charged with Geveloping the website and completed it for the Ohio office -
However, she ran into a problem when she shared the URL with Scott Fisher. She called the Helpdesk and was advised
that for it to work correctly, she would have to setup a peer to peer connection.

Ithas been a few months since we met with the deparment reps for the CA intranet site to give them an update on the
progress of the CA Intranet Site development. We should probably do this soon, to alleviate departments who do not have
representation, such as, FGA/SGA from designing sites that we may not bo able to use in the future.

Who is the appropriate person to represent the FGA/SGA?
