DIANE,

IN RESPONSE TO YOUR INQUIRY ABOUT ADVERTISING EXPERTI'S
INTERACTION WITH THE LA METRO GROUP AND ITS PUBLISHER, MR. HAMM,
THE FOLLOWING OUTLINES EVENTS LEADING UP TO MR. HAMM'S LETTER TO
MR. CAMPBELL LAST MONTH (CORRESPONDENCE WAS NOT DATED):

BACKGROUND --

IN MAY, 1990 ADVERTISING EXPERTI BECAME OUR AGENCY OF RECORD FOR
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADVERTISING. MR. HAMM'S PUBLICATIONS, ALONG
WITH ALL OTHER PUBLICATIONS ON OUR SCHEDULE WERE REVIEWED BY
‘THE AGENCY.

ADVERTISING EXPERTI REQUESTED BACK ISSUES OF THE LA METRO

GROUP'S NEWSPAPERS BOTH IN WRITING AND VERBALLY. THE REQUEST

WAS MET WITH RESISTANCE AND WAS NEVER FULFILLED. AS A RESULT OF

TB. NEWSPAPERS NON-COMPLIANCE, THEY WERE REMOVED FROM THE PM.
A LIST.

ADVERTISING EXPERTI HAS CONTINUED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE LA
METRO GROUP AND ASSURED THE PUBLISHER THAT THEY WOULD BE
CONSIDERED FOR ADVERTISING AS SOON AS ISSUES ARE FORWARDED ON A
REGULAR BASIS.

ADVERTISING EXPERTI'S RECOMMENDATION --

THE AGENCY RECOMMENDS THAT PM USA REFRAIN FROM ADVERTISING
WITH THE LA METRO GROUP. THE PUBLICATION APPEARS TO BE UNSTABLE.
AS A RESULT INCONSISTANT PUBLISHING PRACTICES, E.G. ONLY WHEN THE
NEWSPAPER OBTAINS FINANCIAL BACKING IN THE WAY OF ADVERTISING.

ADDITIONALLY, ADVERTISING EXPERTI HAS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT
MR. HAMM'S QUESTIONABLE BUSINESS BACKGROUND.

NEXT STEPS --

GARRISON JACKSON WILL ATTEND THE NNPA CONVENTION IN MINNEAPOLIS
NEXT WEEK AND IS PREPARED TO DISCUSS PM USA BUSINESS
REQUIREMENTS WITH MR. HAMM (IF MR. HAMM IS IN ATTENDANCE).

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

‘THANK YOU.
