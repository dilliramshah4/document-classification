Charlie Krausse and | discussed the Mentho! Testing request. 1 suggested that before any additional testing is
conducted existing data be obtained, reviewed, and a discussion be held with interested collaborators to determine
what additional testing may be required. Since menthol products have been a topic of many investigations in the past,
the necessary data to answer the questions may already exist. We are in the process of obtaining additional
information. This process will take several weeks. | will stay in touch with Charlie and update him on our progress.

Thanks
Ken
