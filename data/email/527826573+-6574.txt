Chasing Our Customers Away

Tuesday, July 20, 1999; Page AIS

Regarding smoke-free bars, William Fisher, president of the
American Hotel and Motel Association, was right to say the
smoking ban is bad for business [Ietters, July 2], not Stanton Glantz
of the University of California, who holds that the ban has no effect
or a positive effect on tourism [letters, July 13].

Although I cannot speak for restaurant-only sales under California's
smoke-free program, I can assure The Post's readers that "stand-

 

   

Print Ednion alone" bar sales throughout California have been decimated. On
Sunday Quileak average, sales at the local bars, taverns and pubs have dropped
Exlitorials nearly 30 percent since the enactment of the ban. I have talked to

literally thousands of owners and employees who have sales and
income losses as high as 95 percent. Thousands of employees have
— onoursite had their hours cut, and hundreds have lost their jobs because of the
valk Central loss of the smoking customers who form a majority of their
sak & customer base. (Last year, my establishment suffered its worse
performance in 15 years).

 
    

As for the "huge influx of non-smoking customers” who were
supposed to flock to our establishments after the ban -- well, it never
happened. We are attempting to regain our smoking clientele by
introducing a bill that would allow bars and taverns, not restaurants,
to permit smoking in designated areas wherein the latest air filtration
systems are in use.

Contrary to the blatherings of anti-smoking zealots such as Stanton
Glantz, banning smoking in adult bars is not popular -- not with the
employees, not with the customers (especially the tourists from other
states) and most certainly not with the bar owners.
